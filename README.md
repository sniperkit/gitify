### Download
You can download Gitify for **free** from either the website [www.gitify.io](http://www.gitify.io/) or from the GitHub repository [releases](https://github.com/sniperkit/gitify/releases) page.

You can also install Gitify via [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/)

brew cask install gitify
```

Gitify currently only supports OS X.


### Prerequisites

 - Node 6+
 - [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)
 - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
 - [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)


### Installation

    npm install


### Development
First you will need to set the testing `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `src/js/utils/constants.js` file. You can use the development app credentials (use at your own discretion):

    Client Id: 3fef4433a29c6ad8f22c
    Client Secret Key: 9670de733096c15322183ff17ed0fc8704050379


To watch for changes in the `src` directory:

    npm run watch

To run the actual **electron app**:

    npm start


### Distribution
To prepare the app for distribution run:

    npm run package

To publish a new version, you also need to codesign the app running `npm run codesign`. Currently supports only OS X.


### Tests
There are 2 linters for `js` & `scss` and unit tests with `jest`.

    // Run only unit tests
    npm run jest

    // Run linter & unit tests with coverage
    npm run test

### FAQ

#### My notifications aren't showing?

Some organisations require applications to request access before allowing access to any data (including notifications) about their repositories.

To check if Gitify is approved by your organisation you can go to https://github.com/settings/applications, then click on **Gitify** and scroll to _Organization access_.

#### Something looks wrong - How can I debug?

Since version `1.1.0` you can now debug Gitify by pressing `alt+cmd+I`. This will open the devtools and then you can see any logs, network requests etc.
